# Arch Vulnerability Group auditor
avg-audit will check currently installed packages on Arch Linux based systems against https://security.archlinux.org/issues/. This is very similar to pacaudit and archsecure and arch-audit, however it allows for custom formatting of the fields and has all the same features (except the nagios plugin in pacaudit, which I plan to add). It has a couple of other minor improvements as well, such as testing against all known security vulnerabilities including fixed ones, which could be useful in case of outdated software. I also have other features in mind like running as a service, or alongside an update utility.

The C version is a work in progress.

# Installation
`$ wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/i34/avg-audit/master/avg-audit && chmod +x avg-audit`
```
Usage:
    -h    Show this help message
    -a    Show all fields
          This is equal to -f name,packages,status,severity,type,affected,fixed,ticket,issues
    -f    Custom format, e.g. -f packages,affected,severity
    -v    Show all vulnerable packages, not just ones on the system
    -c    Colorize output
    -t    Test against all packages, including fixed ones
    -l    Link to the full AVG URL
    -n    Do not count vulnerable/listed packages at the end
    -b    Alternative database location

Fields:
    name        Link to the Arch Vulnerability Group number
    packages    List of the affected packages
